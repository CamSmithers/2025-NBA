# NBA Model Building & Machine Learning V2
## Overview
## Repository Files
* **NBA Scraping.ipynb**: This file is used to scrape all the data that I may need for this project.
* **NBA HTML Parser.ipynb**: This file is used to parse the HTML files scraped, so I can put the data in to data frames or tables.
* **DataPrep.R**: This script is used for some pre-processing that I neglected doing in the two python files (NBA Scraping and NBA HTML Parser).
* **CleaningScript2.R**: This script is used to perform a majority of the data cleaning needed prior to data exploration or model creation/analysis.
* **DataChecking.R**: This script is used to check smaller chunks of code to check for errors.
* **Organizing Code 2.Rmd**: This file is used to help organize code while Iâ€™m working with multiple data frames, visualizations, and other objects.
* **Exploration.Rmd**: This file is used for data exploration.
